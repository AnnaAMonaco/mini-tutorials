# mini-tutorials
Welcome to the repository for all the "mini-tutorials" on genomics data analysis and visualisation for members of the [Mundlos lab](https://www.molgen.mpg.de/Development-and-Disease)! Here you will find all the markdown files for the informal sessions of data analysis tutorials.

### An ever updating list of mini-tutorials:
- [Basic ChIP-seq analysis](https://github.com/AnnaAMonaco/mini-tutorials/blob/main/basic-ChIP-analysis.md): A walk-through from sequenced fastq file to peaks called with `macs2`, all the basic steps to get to a bigWig file of peaks that can be visualised on a genome browser. As the first mini-tutorial, you will also find a quick start guide to the MPIMG's very own `mxq` scheduling system.
- Data visualisation in R: *coming soon*
- Differential gene expression from bulk RNA-seq using `salmon` and `DESeq2`: *coming soon*
